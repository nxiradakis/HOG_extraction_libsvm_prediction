# HOG features extraction and label SVM prediction 
Histogram of Oriented Gradients feature descriptor from OpenCV (https://github.com/opencv/opencv) is presented in this example for image classification.   
HOG features/data are finally fed to a pre-trained SVM model and the label of input image is predicted using the LIBSVM library (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
